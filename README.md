# Product Analysis & Strategy: QuickPay Hub

This repository contains a complete, data-backed product case study for a proposed fintech feature—**QuickPay Hub**—designed to reduce friction for users who make frequent, repetitive payments.

It demonstrates an end-to-end product development process:
- Hypothesis formation
- Data analysis
- Strategic pivot based on insights
- Final feature recommendation with technical roadmap

## 🔍 Problem Statement: The High-Friction Daily Payment

For millions of users, daily payments for essentials like tea, snacks, or cab rides are repetitive and time-sensitive. The current multi-step UPI flow (open app → scan → enter amount → confirm) is inefficient when performed multiple times a day.

This project aims to validate this pain point using real transaction data and recommend a user-centric product solution.

## 📊 Key Analytical Insights

The full analysis is available in [`analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/analysis.ipynb). Highlights:

- **Power User Segment Exists**  
  From 400,000+ transactions, ~18% of users made 3+ repeat payments to the same merchant in <10 days, contributing 43% of low-value (< ₹100) transactions.

- **Strategic Pivot: Amounts Are Not Fixed**  
  While purchases were repetitive, **70% of these transactions had varying amounts**, invalidating the initial fixed-value QuickPay idea. This led to a **pivot toward a flexible suggestion-based system**.

---

## ✅ The Final Solution: QuickPay Hub

A smart, dynamic payment shortcut inside the app that allows users to:

- Save frequent merchants as “Favourites”
- Tap to quickly initiate a transaction with suggested or custom amounts
- Track rewards and progress for frequent merchants

This balances **speed + flexibility** and supports a habit loop via engagement incentives.
